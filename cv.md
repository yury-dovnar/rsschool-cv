3. **I am 45 years old. I'm from Minsk. My goal is to master the profession of frontend developer. The main thing is to understand the essence of this work. To understand the subtleties and nuances. Become a really real basketball player.
The priority now is the study of HTML and CSS. And also immerse yourself in learning Java Script. That's why I came to the course at RSSCHOOL.
I am patient and persistent. I do not panic when it is impossible to find solutions to a particular problem. On the contrary, it encourages me in a good way to take actions that are aimed at solving these problems. I am executive, there is a healthy perfectionism. I am completely immersed in my work.
Now I work in a non-IT field. But on my own, in the evenings, after work, I sit at my laptop and try to study as much as possible and get closer to my goal, which I wrote above**

4. **I have completed courses on setting up advertising in YAN (Yandex advertising network). I studied Photoshop. And I took courses on creating (design and layout) sites for Instagram on the Taplink platform.**

5. **At the moment I am taking an English language course.**
